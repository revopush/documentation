# What is Revopush 2.0

Revopush 2.0 is the next major version of Revopush platform and SDKs, bringing intelligent,
byte-level patching to modernize React Native delivery, replacing full-bundle updates with high-efficiency diffs.

The transition from full bundles to binary patches dramatically reduces update sizes (10-100x), accelerates delivery
times (up to 1000x faster), and minimizes bandwidth consumption.


All the benefits available for both green field projects and existing Revopush/CodePush setups using RN **v0.76** and above.
