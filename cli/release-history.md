# Viewing Release History

You can view a history of the 50 most recent releases for a specific app deployment using the following command:

```shell
revopush deployment history <appName> <deploymentName>
```

The history will display all attributes about each release (e.g. label, mandatory) as well as indicate if any releases were made due to a promotion or a rollback operation.

Additionally, the history displays the install metrics for each release. You can view the details about how to interpret the metric data in the documentation for the `deployment ls` command above.

By default, the history doesn't display the author of each release, but if you are collaborating on an app with other developers, and want to view who released each update, you can pass the additional `--displayAuthor` (or `-a`) flag to the history command.

_NOTE: The history command can also be run using the "h" alias_

## Clearing Release History

You can clear the release history associated with a deployment using the following command:

```shell
revopush deployment clear <appName> <deploymentName>
```

After running this command, client devices configured to receive updates using its associated deployment key will no longer receive the updates that have been cleared. This command is irreversible, and therefore should not be used in a production deployment.
