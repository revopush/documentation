## 1. Introduction

Welcome! This guide will help you migrate your Over-the-Air (OTA) updates from Appcenter to Revopush.
With Revopush's Command Line Interface (CLI), you can easily push updates directly to your users' devices
without needing to go through app stores.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to install the Revopush CLI
- Migrating your existing OTA updates from Appcenter
- Setting up and managing your applications and deployments in Revopush
- Updating your React Native app to use Revopush for OTA updates

Let’s get started!

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following (depends on your platform and preferences):

- **Developer Tools Installed:**
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
 - npm or Yarn
 - npx
 - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
 - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- **Permissions:**
 - Ability to install npm packages globally.

- **Revopush Account:**
 - Sign up at [Revopush](https://revopush.org/) using GitHub or Google for authentication.

- **(If Migrating) Appcenter Access:**
 - Ensure you have access to your existing Appcenter account and its CLI.

### 2.1 Installing Required Tools
You manage most of CodePush's functionality using the App Center CLI.
If you had one installed, you can update it to the latest version by running the following command:

```shell
npm update -g appcenter
```

or install it from scratch by running the following command:

```shell
npm install -g appcenter@latest
```

Upon installation or update, you can check the version of the App Center CLI by running the following command:

```shell
appcenter -h
```

which will display the version of the App Center CLI you have installed with available commands.

```shell
$ appcenter -h 

Visual Studio App Center helps you build, test, distribute, and monitor mobile apps.

    setup-autocomplete             Setup tab completion for your shell 
```

### 2.2 Setting Up Revopush CLI
Similarly to Appcenter Revopush manages the most of CodePush's functionality using CLI.

To install it run the following command:

**Install Revopush CLI:**
```shell
npm install -g @revopush/code-push-cli
```

**Update Revopush CLI to the Latest Version:**
```shell
npm update -g @revopush/code-push-cli
```

Upon installation or update, you can check the version of the Revopush CLI and the list of available commands by running the following command:

**Verify Installation:**
```shell
revopush -h
```

which will display the version of the Revopush CLI you have installed with available commands.

```shell
revopush -h
 ____                 ____            _

## 3. Migrating from Appcenter to Revopush

You need to execute steps in this section if you have been using Appcenter for OTA updates and wish to migrate to Revopush.

If you did not use Appcenter OTA updates before and just wish to apply
OTA on top of Revopush for your app feel free to skip this section and go to section [4](#4-setting-up-revopush-from-scratch).

### 3.1 Logging In

Execute the following command to login to Appcenter CLI using provider of your choice (GitHub, Facebook, Microsoft, Google):

```shell
appcenter login
```

Similarly, in a separate window login to Revopush CLI using the following command:

```shell
revopush login
```

### 3.2 Migrating Applications and Deployments
**1. List Your Appcenter Apps:**

```shell
appcenter apps list
```

Example Output:

```shell
johndoe/rn2_android
johndoe/rn2_ios
```

For given guide we assume that `johndoe/rn2_android` is the React Native application for Android and `johndoe/rn2_ios`
is the React Native application for iOS.

You can check target OS of the app using command `appcenter apps show -a <app name here>`.

**Android:**

```shell
appcenter apps show -a johndoe/rn2_android
App Secret:            6c3cb412-105f-422f-b795-af53d0b36a5f
Description:           
Display Name:          rn2_android
Name:                  rn2_android
OS:                    Android
Platform:              React-Native
Release Type:          Alpha
Owner ID:              a1265e53-0599-4340-8003-7c40f0caff38
Owner Display Name:    John Doe
Owner Email:           johndoe@joghdoe.com
Owner Name:            johndoe
Azure Subscription ID: 
```

**iOS:**

```shell
appcenter apps show -a johndoe/rn2_ios    
App Secret:            37d1dce7-a991-4ccc-8a0c-1ff8ed00f45d
Description:           
Display Name:          rn2_ios
Name:                  rn2_ios
OS:                    iOS
Platform:              React-Native
Release Type:          
Owner ID:              a2265e53-0699-4340-8003-7c41f0caff39
Owner Display Name:    John Doe
Owner Email:           johndoe@johndoe.com
Owner Name:            johndoe
Azure Subscription ID: 
```


**2. Create Corresponding Revopush Apps:**

Remove the username prefix when creating apps in Revopush.

```shell
revopush app add rn2_ios
revopush app add rn2_android
```

Example Output:

```shell
Successfully added the "rn2_ios" app, along with the following default deployments:
┌────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Name       │ Deployment Key                         │
├────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Production │ Z7v_81HyATiWlqZjvQFyu9GIicXAVJHvdy5W-g │
├────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Staging    │ PjAEsKZUdAytb5Rq3Kb6yHVfn-H3VJHvdy5W-g │
└────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```shell
Successfully added the "rn2_android" app, along with the following default deployments:
┌────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Name       │ Deployment Key                         │
├────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Production │ EVGdS0GR4Sus584cdyZ95wmwI405VJHvdy5W-g │
├────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Staging    │ pkCafa80S-ji3y6Xey6zVcEju9AHVJHvdy5W-g │
└────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────┘
```


**3. Replicate Deployments:**

List Appcenter deployments:

```shell
appcenter codepush deployment list -k -a johndoe/rn2_ios
```

Add the same deployments in Revopush with identical keys

```shell
revopush deployment add rn2_ios appcenter_Staging -k <Staging_Key>
revopush deployment add rn2_ios appcenter_Production -k <Production_Key>
```

Repeat for Android

```shell
appcenter codepush deployment list -k -a johndoe/rn2_android
revopush deployment add rn2_android appcenter_Staging -k <Staging_Key>
revopush deployment add rn2_android appcenter_Production -k <Production_Key>
```

Repeat for all other deployment you have in Appcenter and wish to continue to use in Revopush.

## 4. Setting Up Revopush from Scratch

If you're new to Revopush and want to set up OTA updates for your app, follow these steps.

### 4.1 Logging In

```shell
revopush login
```

### 4.2 Creating Applications

#### For iOS

```shell
revopush app add myAmazingApp_ios
```

#### For Android:

```shell
revopush app add myAmazingApp_android
```

This will create your app along with default Staging and Production deployments.

### 4.3 Creating Deployments

If you need more deployments (e.g., Development, Testing), use:

```shell
revopush deployment add myAmazingApp_android Development
```

List All Deployments:

```shell
revopush deployment ls myAmazingApp_android -k
```

## 5. Updating Your React Native App

After setting up Revopush, update your React Native application to point to the Revopush server.

### 5.1 iOS Configuration

1. **Open `Info.plist`:** Add the following entries:

```xml
<key>CodePushDeploymentKey</key>
<string>Your_Deployment_Key</string>
<key>CodePushServerURL</key>
<string>https://api.revopush.org</string>
```

An example for `myAmazingApp_ios` app and `Staging` deployment:

```xml
<key>CodePushDeploymentKey</key>
<string>vUOFPtZfOlhXHPEDE3nkf7nP6lJ4VJHvdy5W-g</string>
<key>CodePushServerURL</key>
<string>https://api.revopush.org</string>
```

2. **Dynamic Deployment Key (Optional):** To switch deployments dynamically in your JavaScript code, use [Code-Push options](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/docs/api-js.md#CodePushOptions)

### 5.2 Android Configuration

1. Open `strings.xml`: Add the following entries:

```xml
<string moduleConfig="true" name="CodePushDeploymentKey">Your_Deployment_Key</string>
<string moduleConfig="true" name="CodePushServerUrl">https://api.revopush.org</string>
```

An example `myAmazingApp_android` app and `Staging` deployment `strings.xml`:

```xml
<string moduleConfig="true" name="CodePushDeploymentKey">kbAXqSrgEfLPcuvU3Fe0SCqX5HpOVJHvdy5W-g</string>
<string moduleConfig="true" name="CodePushServerUrl">https://api.revopush.org</string>
```

2.  **Dynamic Deployment Key (Optional):** To switch deployments dynamically in your JavaScript code, use [Code-Push options](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/docs/api-js.md#CodePushOptions)
