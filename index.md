## What is CodePush?

CodePush is an OTA (Over The Air) update service for React Native applications. 
It allows developers to deliver JavaScript and asset updates directly to their users' devices.

The service consists of three main parts:

**CodePush Server** – a web server and API responsible for managing and distributing updates to mobile clients, as well as collecting usage statistics.

**Management CLI** – a tool that enables developers to manage updates, including integrating update processes into their CI/CD pipelines.

**CodePush SDK** – a React Native library that allows apps to receive and apply updates from the CodePush server.

::: warning
This service was provided by Microsoft as part of App Center, which will be [retired](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/retirement) on **March 31, 2025**.
